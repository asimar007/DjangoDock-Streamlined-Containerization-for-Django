## INSTALL DOCKER

A very detailed instructions to install Docker are provide in the below link

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

For Demo, 

You can create an Ubuntu EC2 Instance on AWS and run the below commands to install docker.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```


### Start Docker and Grant Access

A very common mistake that many beginners do is, After they install docker using the sudo access, they miss the step to Start the Docker daemon and grant acess to the user they want to use to interact with docker and run docker commands.

Always ensure the docker daemon is up and running.

A easy way to verify your Docker installation is by running the below command

```
docker run hello-world
```

If the output says:

```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

This can mean two things, 
1. Docker deamon is not running.
2. Your user does not have access to run docker commands.


### Start Docker daemon

You use the below command to verify if the docker daemon is actually started and Active

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If you notice that the docker daemon is not running, you can start the daemon using the below command

```
sudo systemctl start docker
```


### Grant Access to your user to run docker commands

To grant access to your user to run the docker command, you should add the user to the Docker Linux group. Docker group is create by default when docker is installed.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

In the above command `ubuntu` is the name of the user, you can change the username appropriately.

**NOTE:** : You need to logout and login back for the changes to be reflected.


### Docker is Installed, up and running ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

Use the same command again, to verify that docker is up and running.

```
docker run hello-world
```

Output should look like:

```
....
....
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
...
```


### Clone this repository and move to example folder

```
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Docker-Zero-to-Hero
cd  examples
```
